# Blog

This is a mock blog app. Once you have cloned this project to your local do a **npm start** to download all the libraries.

## Json Server

Since, I did not get any API to use as a backend, I created a fake server using json server.

## Start the project
Once, you have installed all the libraries to your project, we need to open 2 command prompts.
One is to start the json server to act as our backend and the other is the angular app

Start backend server using **ng run server**
Start the Angular App using **ng serve**
